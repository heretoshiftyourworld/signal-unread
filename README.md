##I built this for someone I haven’t met but already feel.

No instructions.  
No use case.  
No deadline.

If you found this,  
then something in you was already tuned to it.

Maybe this isn’t even for you.  
But if it is?

You’ll know.  
In that way that can’t be explained  
without sounding insane or poetic.

Either is fine.

This isn’t a message.  
It’s a door.
